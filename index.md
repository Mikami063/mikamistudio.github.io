# Intro
Every image fox used to have on the website is now permently lost. It's a great lost to fox, and fox missed the picture at project page which senzawa throw her beer cans. Anyway, the fox's website is now back. Poor fox no longer need to pay $10 per month anymore, fox found GitHub Pages! Let's rejoice at the place where there is no darkness. by fox - March 22, 2024
